# Sources

These dotfiles didn’t come out of thin air. To reduce dependences, I’ve
opted to keep as much stuff stored in this repository rather than
`curl`-ing or cloning every bit of code from the original sources.

That said, this document exists to outilnes some of the sources that were
used to create much of the configuration that these dotfiles include.

- [Z Jump](https://github.com/rupa/z)
- [Papercolor theme for iTerm](https://github.com/dinhtungdu/papercolor-iterm2) was used to generate the iTerm preferences file in use.
- [TODO.txt vim plugin](https://github.com/freitass/todo.txt-vim) is used in the `neovim` configuration files
- Karabiner config comes mostly from community created rules or slight edits of them
  - [Right option --> hyper](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#right_option_to_hyper) was modified to use right shift
  - [Caps lock + HJKL arrows, escape if alone](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#Vimode_with_smart_caps) - i just use the first of these four rules
  - I map right command to left control because control + tab to cycle through tabs requires two pinkies
